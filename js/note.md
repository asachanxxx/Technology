-if you want to scape some charactors use back slash \
    EX: "Hello world "Say it" " -- this will be an error
    Correct: "Hello world \"Say it\" "

- Or you can say it like this
    -- 'Hello world "Say it"'

- so you use '' to define string it will ignore the "" 

- BODMAS  - procedance of operators 
    - B - () , o - Powers , D - Devition , M-  multipication , A- add , S- Substraction
    - EX: Math.pow(2,4) / 2+1-5+(2*12) = 28 (Figure out how this will happen)

- Power of in JS 
    EX:  4 *= 2 = 16 (4*4)
         4 **= 2 = 256 (4*4*4)

- + operator is overloaded
    - 10+ 10 = 20
    - "asanga" + 120 = "asanga120"  (+ operator is take integer 120 and converts it to string and concatanate )
    - above will happen either left or right paranthesis
    - also you can use += in strings

- HTML IS "Block Loading"  it is loading line by lines
